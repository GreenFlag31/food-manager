          My name is <span class="emphasize">Manu Claeys</span>, I'm a junior
          Front-End Developer. I studied music and economics, and then I turned
          to Web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered programming in March 2020 while optimizing an Excel file
          using VBA. Since then, I'm passionated about programming. Coding is
          like a game of logic and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coding is the synthesis of my path: music (creativity) + economics
          (logic) = Coding (Web development) ðŸ™ƒ
        </p>
        <p>This is my first app in <span class="angular">Angular</span>.</p>
